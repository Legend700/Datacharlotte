    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Music streaming platforms like Apple Music have transformed the way users experience music. With millions of tracks and a wide diversity of genres and styles, there's an increasing interest in understanding how songs can be grouped based on inherent characteristics rather than explicit genre labels. This approach opens the door to new possibilities in recommendation systems, playlist creation, and music discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Spotify, Apple Music does not provide granular audio features such as danceability or energy through its public API. However, Apple Music does offer access to metadata like artist, genre, duration, and release date. For this project, we use these metadata features to perform clustering analysis and investigate whether songs in a user’s library can be grouped based on stylistic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project not only explores clustering techniques but also demonstrates how basic music metadata can offer deep insights into listening behavior, preferred genres, and potential playlist structures. It highlights the power of unsupervised machine learning in the creative domain."

    "Understanding Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group data points with similar characteristics without using predefined labels. It allows for exploratory data analysis and can uncover hidden structures within datasets. In this project, clustering helps group songs that share similar metadata characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use K-Means clustering, a popular method due to its simplicity and speed. K-Means works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting a number of clusters (k).\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly initializing centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning each point to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalculating the centroids based on assigned points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating until centroids stabilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "We determine the optimal value of k using the Elbow Method. This method helps find the point at which adding more clusters doesn’t significantly reduce the inertia (within-cluster sum of squares), making it an effective tool to balance complexity and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comes from a user’s Apple Music library, accessed via Apple’s MusicKit API. The data includes the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "track_name: Title of the song\n",
    "\n",
    "artist: Name of the artist\n",
    "\n",
    "album: Album title\n",
    "\n",
    "genre: Primary genre classification\n",
    "\n",
    "release_date: Date the track was released\n",
    "\n",
    "duration_ms: Duration of the track in milliseconds\n",
    "\n",
    "track_number: Track number in the album\n",
    "\n",
    "This metadata, while limited compared to audio feature sets from services like Spotify, still provides valuable insights into a user's listening habits, genre preferences, and release trends over time.\n",

Future extensions could incorporate sentiment analysis of lyrics, integration with external platforms like Last.fm for richer tagging, or even building recommendation engines that dynamically adjust playlists based on user mood and historical trends.\n",
